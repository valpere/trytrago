# Security Enhancements for TryTraGo API

The following security enhancements have been implemented to strengthen the TryTraGo application:

## 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

### New Components:
- **Validation Middleware** (`interface/api/rest/middleware/validation.go`): Enhanced to sanitize query and path parameters
- **Custom Validators** (`domain/validator/validators.go`): Added robust validators for input fields
- **Input Sanitization Utils** (`domain/utils/sanitize.go`): Provides functions to clean different types of input
- **Validation Utils** (`domain/utils/validate.go`): Provides functions to validate common data types

### Key Features:
- HTML escaping and tag removal
- SQL injection detection and prevention
- XSS protection through content sanitization
- Input length validation
- Type-specific validation (email, UUID, language codes, etc.)

## 2. CORS Configuration

### New Components:
- **CORS Middleware** (`interface/api/rest/middleware/cors.go`): Implements configurable CORS policies

### Key Features:
- Environment-specific CORS configurations (stricter in production)
- Support for multiple origins, methods, and headers
- Wildcard subdomain support
- Credentials handling
- Preflight request handling

## 3. Security Headers

### New Components:
- **Security Middleware** (`interface/api/rest/middleware/security.go`): Adds important security headers
- **Request Size Limiter** (`interface/api/rest/middleware/request_size.go`): Prevents large request attacks

### Key Headers:
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Content-Type-Options (nosniff)
- X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Referrer-Policy
- Cache control headers for API endpoints

## 4. Configuration Updates

### Changes:
- **Config Structure** (`domain/config.go`): Extended with security configurations
- **Config YAML** (`config.yaml`): Added security-related configuration options

### New Options:
- CORS configurations (allowed origins, methods, etc.)
- Security header settings
- Request size limits
- TLS settings

## 5. Handler Improvements

### Changes:
- **Entry Handler** (`interface/api/rest/handler/entry_handler.go`): Updated with input sanitization
- **Other handlers**: Similar updates for other handlers

### Key Improvements:
- UUID validation for path parameters
- Search query sanitization
- Pagination parameter validation and capping
- Entry type validation
- String fields sanitization

## Implementation Notes

1. **Development vs. Production**: Different security settings are applied based on the environment
2. **Defensive Coding**: Assumptions about input validity are avoided
3. **Error Handling**: Security-related errors are logged appropriately
4. **Performance**: Sanitization is applied only where needed to maintain performance

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. Input validation at all entry points
2. Parameterized queries (through the repository layer)
3. Output encoding to prevent XSS
4. Security headers for browser protections
5. CSRF protections
6. CORS restrictions
7. Rate limiting
8. Request size limitations
9. Data minimization principles
10. Proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

These enhancements create multiple layers of defense that work together to protect the application against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, injection attacks, and more.
