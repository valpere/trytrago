# Security Tests Summary

This document provides an overview of the tests implemented to validate the security enhancements in the TryTraGo application.

## Unit Tests

### Validation Utilities (`test/unit/utils/validation_test.go`)
- Tests for validating UUIDs
- Tests for validating email addresses
- Tests for validating entry types
- Tests for validating language codes
- Tests for validating pagination parameters
- Tests for validating sort fields
- Tests for validating passwords

### Sanitization Utilities (`test/unit/utils/sanitize_test.go`)
- Tests for sanitizing general strings
- Tests for sanitizing email addresses
- Tests for sanitizing usernames
- Tests for detecting SQL injection patterns
- Tests for sanitizing search queries
- Tests for sanitizing JSON content
- Tests for sanitizing filenames
- Tests for sanitizing maps and arrays
- Tests for sanitizing language codes
- Tests for sanitizing UUIDs

### Security Middleware (`test/unit/middleware/security_test.go`)
- Tests for security headers
- Tests for CORS middleware
- Tests for request size limiter
- Tests for validation middleware
- Tests for request ID middleware

### Handler Tests (`test/unit/handler/entry_handler_test.go`)
- Tests for sanitization in `ListEntries` handler
- Tests for sanitization in `CreateEntry` handler
- Tests for sanitization in `GetEntry` handler

## Integration Tests

### Security Integration (`test/integration/security/security_integration_test.go`)
- Tests for security headers in full request flow
- Tests for CORS headers in full request flow
- Tests for CSRF protection
- Tests for XSS protection
- Tests for request size limiting
- Tests for SQL injection protection

## Test Coverage

The implemented tests cover:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensuring that all user inputs are properly validated
2. **Input Sanitization**: Confirming that potentially dangerous inputs are sanitized
3. **Security Headers**: Verifying that proper security headers are included in responses
4. **CORS Configuration**: Testing that CORS policies are properly enforced
5. **Request Size Limiting**: Ensuring that large requests are properly rejected
6. **CSRF Protection**: Confirming that CSRF protection is working correctly

## Running the Tests

Execute the tests using:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./test/...

# Run just the security tests
go test ./test/unit/utils/... ./test/unit/middleware/... ./test/integration/security/...

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./test/...

# Run with coverage report
go test -cover ./test/...
```

## Extending the Tests

When adding new security features, consider adding tests for:

1. **Edge Cases**: Test extremes and boundary conditions
2. **Malicious Payloads**: Test with known attack patterns (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
3. **Performance**: Ensure security measures don't significantly impact performance
4. **Integration**: Verify that all security layers work together properly

## Security Test Best Practices

- **Positive and Negative Tests**: Include both valid inputs and attack vectors
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Base tests on real-world attack patterns
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all APIs and entry points
- **Automation**: Integrate security tests into CI/CD pipeline
- **Regular Updates**: Keep tests updated with new vulnerability patterns

These tests provide a solid foundation for ensuring the security of the TryTraGo application. However, security testing is an ongoing process that should be regularly reviewed and updated as new vulnerabilities and attack vectors emerge.
